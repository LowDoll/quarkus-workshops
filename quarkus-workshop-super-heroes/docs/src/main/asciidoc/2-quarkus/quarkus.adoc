In the previous chapter, you had a quick peek at Quarkus and how you can build HTTP / REST-based applications with it.
But that was just the beginning; Quarkus can do a lot more, which is the purpose of this chapter.
In this chapter, you are going to see:

* What's Quarkus? and how does it change the Java landscape
* What are the main Quarkus idea, and how it helps in the _cloud native world_
* The Quarkus build process, in other words, the _secret sauce number 1_
* The Quarkus reactive nature, in other words, the _secret sauce number 2_
* Some Quarkus features such as the application lifecycle support
* How you can use Quarkus to generate native executable

== What's Quarkus?

Java was born more than 25 years ago.
The world 25 years ago was quite different.
The software industry has gone through several revolutions over these two decades.
Java has always been able to reinvent itself to stay relevant.

But a new revolution is happening.
While for years, most applications were running on huge machines, with lots of CPU and memory, they are now running on the Cloud, in constrained environments, in containers, where the resources are shared.
Density is the new optimization: crank as many mini-apps (or microservices) as possible per node.
And scale by adding more instances of an app instead of a more powerful single instance.

The Java ergonomics, designed 20 years ago, do not fit well in this new environment.
Java applications were designed to run 24/7 for months, even years.
The JIT is optimizing the execution over time; the GC manages the memory efficiently...
But all these features have a cost, and the memory required to run Java applications and startup times are showstoppers when you deploy 20 or 50 microservices instead of one application.
The issue is not the JVM itself; it's also the Java ecosystem that needs to be reinvented.

That's where Quarkus, and other projects, enter the game.
Quarkus uses a build time principle.footnote:[Also called Ahead-of-Time Compilation https://www.graalvm.org/docs/reference-manual/native-image]
During the build of the application, tasks that usually happen at runtime are executed at build time.

Thus, when the application runs, everything has been pre-computed, and all the annotation scanning, XML parsing, and so on won't be executed anymore.
It has two direct benefits: startup time (a lot faster) and memory consumption (a lot lower).

So, as depicted in the figure above, Quarkus does bring an infrastructure for frameworks to embrace build time metadata discovery (like annotations), replace proxies with generated classes, pre-configure most frameworks, and handle dependency injection at build time.

Also, during the build, Quarkus detects which class needs to be accessed by reflection at runtime, boots framework at build time to record the result, and generally offers a lot of GraalVM optimization for free (or cheap at least).
Indeed, thanks to all this metadata, Quarkus can configure native compilers such as the GraalVM compiler to generate a native executable for your Java application.
Thanks to an aggressive dead-code elimination, the final executable is smaller, faster to start, and uses a ridiculously small amount of memory.

Quarkus does not stop there.
As you have seen in the previous chapter, it proposes a stellar developer experience.
It also unifies reactive and imperative to let you decide how you want to handle I/O. It allows implementing both REST and event-driven applications using a consistent model.
To do this, Quarkus is based on a reactive core allowing high concurrency and reducing memory consumption.

// TODO IMAGE

Quarkus detects if your method can be called on the I/O thread and follows the reactive execution model; or if your method must be called on a worker thread and follows the imperative execution model.

Ok, but enough talking, time to see this in action.
