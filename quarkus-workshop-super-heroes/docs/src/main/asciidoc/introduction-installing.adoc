== CodeReady Workspace

CodeReady Workspaces is a collaborative Kubernetes-native development solution that delivers OpenShift workspaces and in-browser IDE for rapid cloud application development.
An access to CRW will be provided.

=== CRW Configuration

* Access to your CRW and sign up with the credentials provided:

	user: USERNAME
	pwd: openshift

	Luego en el formulario de registro pon lo que quieras (excepto username que tiene que ser user2), por ejemplo:

	email: user2@ocp.com
	first name: User
	last name: U2

* Configure a Quarkus workspace in the Get Started

* Give more memory to your workspace:
We need to increase the memory allowed to our workspace. To do that go to your workspace settings, select Devfile and modify the `memoryLimit` parameter, 2048Mi should be enough:

`Workspaces -> quarkus-XXXX -> Devfile`

[source,yaml]
----
memoryLimit: 2048Mi
----

* Finally, open a terminal from the Terminal menu -> Open Terminal in specific container -> maven.

=== Command Line Utilities

Just make sure the following commands work on your CRW terminal

[source,shell]
----
$ java -version
$ mvn -version
$ curl --version
----

== OpenShift Container Platform

Your lab environment includes Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

Access to your OCP resources can be gained via both the `oc` CLI utility and the OCP web console.

=== Overview
The project we are going to develop will contain 3 microservices accessing to a PostgreSQL database. We will make the databases to run in a OpenShift dedicated namespace.

=== OpenShift Namespaces

. In the terminal of your CRW, authenticate into OpenShift as a non cluster admin user (USERNAME) using the `oc` utility.

NOTE: You can get the command for authenticating from the OpenShift Web Console.
[source,shell]
----
$ oc login
----

The namespace created for hosting your CRW environment is USERNAME-codeready where `USERNAME` correspond to your specific username.

. Create the namespace for hosting the databases running the following command.

[source,shell]
----
$ oc new-project USERNAME-heroes
----

NOTE: change the USERNAME with your own.

=== Operators

Your lab environment comes pre-installed with various OpenShift operators.

*AMQ Streams*

This operator is responsible for managing a Kafka cluster running within an OpenShift cluster. In particular, the operator will create the kafka server, the topic and configure its parameters.

*PostgreSQL operator*

The PostgreSQL operator allows to package, install, configure and manage a PostgreSQL database within an OpenShift cluster.
This operator is not pre-installed. We need to do it.

#Congratulations!#
Your lab environment is now ready to use.
