Let's start from the beginning...
Quarkus.
What's Quarkus?
That's a pretty good question, and probably a good start.
If you go to the https://quarkus.io[Quarkus web site], you'll read that Quarkus is "_A Kubernetes Native Java stack tailored for OpenJDK HotSpot & GraalVM, crafted from the best of breed Java libraries and standards_".
This description is rather unclear, but does a very good job at using bankable keywords, right?
It's also written: "_Supersonic Subatomic Java_".
Still very foggy.
In practice, Quarkus is an Open Source stack to write Java applications, specifically backend applications.
In this workshop, we are going to explain what Quarkus is, and, because the best way to understand Quarkus is to use it, build a set of microservices with it.
Don't be mistaken, Quarkus is not limited to microservices, and we are going to learn about this in the workshop.


This workshop offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with Quarkus, from the first line of code to making services, to consuming them, and finally to assembling everything in a consistent system.
But, what are we going to build?
Well, it's going to be a set of microservices (we want to be trendy):

* Using Quarkus
* Using HTTP and events (Kafka)
* With some parts of the dark side of microservices (resilience, monitoring with Prometheus)
* Answer the ultimate question: are super heroes stronger than super villains?

This workshop is a BYOL (_Bring Your Own Laptop_) session, so bring your Windows, OSX, or Linux laptop.
You need JDK 11+ on your machine, Apache Maven (3.6+), and Docker.
On Windows, some parts may be qualified as _experimental_.
On Mac and Windows, Docker for _x_ is recommended instead of the Docker toolbox setup.

What you are going to learn:

* What is Quarkus and how you can use it
* How to build an HTTP endpoint (REST API) with Quarkus
* How to access a relational database
* How you can use Swagger and OpenAPI
* How you test your microservice
* How you improve the resilience of your service
* How to build event-driven and reactive microservices with Kafka
* How to build a native executable
* How to extend Quarkus with extensions
* And much more...

Ready? Here we go!
