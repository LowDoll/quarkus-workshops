= From Microservice to Microservices

'''

So far we've built two microservices: the villains and heroes microservices.
In the following sections you will develop an extra microservice: a _fight_ microservice where heroes and villains fight.
We will also add an Angular front-end, so we can fight graphically.

Each microservice is developed in it's own directory.
