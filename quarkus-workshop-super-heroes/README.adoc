= Workshop Super Heroes

== Instructions

Check https://quarkus.io/quarkus-workshops/super-heros/ to get the workshop instructions.

== Generate the documentation

You can either generate the documentation for each exercise or for the entire workshop.
For that, you just run the Maven command `mvn clean generate-resources` under an `docs` directory.

== Start the infrastructure

This workshop requires a couple of extra _technical_ services (databases, kafka...).
Start them using the `docker-compose.yaml` file located in the `infrastructure` directory:

```
cd containers
docker-compose up
```

Stop them using:

```
CTRL+C
docker-compose down
docker-compose rm
```

== Build

```bash
mvn clean install
```

== Running the full system

* Run the infrastructure as explained above.
* In a new terminal, run the heroes microservice
```bash
cd rest-heroes-complete
mvn clean compile quarkus:dev
```
* In a new terminal, run the villains microservice
```bash
cd rest-villains-complete
